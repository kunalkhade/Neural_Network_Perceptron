# Neural Network Perceptron
Neural_Network_Perceptron

## Description 
Develop generic binary classifier perceptron class in ML.py. It has to take
training set of any size. Class must include four functions : 
### init ()
### fit() 
### net input()
### predict()

For this experiment iris data set is used which is very common for machine
learning. Data set consist of 3 different flowers setosa, versicolor and virginica.
Only 2 parameters considered Sepal length and Petal length of two flowers.
